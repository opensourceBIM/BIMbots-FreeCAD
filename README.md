# BIMbots-FreeCAD
A FreeCAD plugin to communicate with BIMbots services - http://bimbots.org/

![](doc/images/bimbots-ui-01.jpg)

This FreeCAD plugin allows a user to: 
1. Upload a FreeCAD model or selected parts of a FreeCAD model to a BIMBots instance (usually a [BIMServer](http://bimserver.org/) with external services enabled)  
2. Perform different services and analyses on their model  
3. Read said results in FreeCAD (usually in the form of a text report) or a BCF file (not yet supported - see below)  

This plugin is written in Python and consists of a single all-in-one Python file along with a companion FreeCAD macro for convenience. 
It can be used in several ways: 

### Run BIMBots within FreeCAD
* The main usage is to work within [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) and be simply launched as a macro.  
* If you have the [BIM Workbench](https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench) installed, this BIMBots plugin will be automatically detected at start and you will find a **BIMBots** command under **Utils** menu.

### Run BIMBots from the CLI
The BIMBots plugin can also be run directly from the command line terminal, in which case it prints a list of services it was able to reach, or imported as a python module (Python 2 and Python 3 compatible), in which case you have access to several utility functions to retrieve and communicate with BIMbots services. So essentiall this can also be used as a library to build your own BIMBots client.

Check the [API documentation](doc/documentation.md) page (autogenerated with [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/)) and the [FreeCAD GUI documentation](doc/ui-documentation.md).

### How to install
In FreeCAD, just head to menu **Tools -> Addons Manager**, locate the BIMBots addon, press the **Install** button, and restart FreeCAD. 

### How to use
Once installed, you will find a **BIMBots** entry under menu **Macro -> Macros**. If you have the [BIM Workbench](https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench) also installed, the BIMBots plugin will be automatically detected at start and you will find a **BIMBots** command under menu **Utils**.  
Refer to the [documentation](doc/ui-documentation.md) for complete use instructions.  

### Features

#### When used as a Python module, it can:

* Retrive a list of BIMbots services
* Authenticate with any of the services
* Keep authentication credentials in a config file
* Test services (send a minimal test IFC file that is guaranteed to work)
* Send actual IFC files
* Get the results

#### When running inside FreeCAD:

* All functionality is available from the GUI
* Auto-discover available services
* Add/remove custom servers
* Authenticate with services
* Send model data to any service
* Display JSON or text reports
* Double-click results (JSON results only) to select corresponding objects in the 3D view

#### To do (help welcome!):

* Handle Context-Id (reuse an already sent model slot)
* Handle asynchronous connection (don't wait and freeze the FreeCAD interface while data is being transmitted)
* Implement display of BCF files in FreeCAD (in progess - Part of a [GSOC](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=35465) project)

#### Quick how-to use from Python

```
>>> import bimbots
>>> bimbots.get_service_providers()
```

This returns a dictionary containing the different service providers found (both auto-discovered and manually added via the FreeCAD UI):

```
[{u'listUrl': u'https://ifcanalysis.bimserver.services/servicelist', u'name': u'ifcanalyses'}, 
 {u'listUrl': u'http://localhost:8080/servicelist', u'name': u'Default localdev BIMserver', 
  u'description': u'Default localdev BIMserver'}, {u'listUrl': u'http://localhost:8081/servicelist', 
  u'name': u'2nd localdev BIMserver', u'description': u'2nd localdev BIMserver'}, 
 {u'listUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/servicelist', u'name': u'Default JAR runner', 
  u'description': u'Default JAR runner'}, {u'listUrl': u'https://thisisanexperimentalserver.com/servicelist', 
  u'name': u'Experimentalserver.com', u'description': u'Experimental BIMserver'}]
```
Then, using one of the "listUrl" above:

`>>> bimbots.get_services('http://localhost:8082/servicelist')`

This returns a list of services offered by the given server (adding the /servicelist is optional):

```
[{u'inputs': [u'IFC_STEP_2X3TC1'], u'resourceUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/services', 
  u'description': u'IFC Analytics Service', u'outputs': [u'IFC_ANALYTICS_JSON_1_0'], 
  u'providerIcon': u'/img/bimserver.png', u'provider': u"Yorik's test BIMserver", 
  u'oauth': {u'tokenUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/access', 
             u'registerUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/register', 
             u'authorizationUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/authorize'}, 
  u'id': 2097206, u'name': u'IFC Analytics Service'}, 
 {u'inputs': [u'IFC_STEP_2X3TC1'], u'resourceUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/services', 
  u'description': u'BIMserver plugin that provides an analysis of a model and and outputs it into json', 
  u'outputs': [u'UNSTRUCTURED_UTF8_TEXT_1_0'], u'providerIcon': u'/img/bimserver.png', 
  u'provider': u"Yorik's test BIMserver", 
  u'oauth': {u'tokenUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/access', 
             u'registerUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/register', 
             u'authorizationUrl': u'http://localhost:8082/oauth/authorize'}, 
  u'id': 2162742, u'name': u'Simple Analyses Service'}]
```
The next step, if you want to use a service, is to authenticate with it. This is done in two steps. Step 1 is done using one of the "registeUrl" above:

`>>> bimbots.authenticate_step_1('http://localhost:8082/oauth/register')`

This will return a dict with keys that identify our BIMbots plugin on the given server.

`>>> bimbots.authenticate_step_2('http://localhost:8082/oauth/authorize', 'freecad', 'Simple Analyses Service')`

Client_id and service_name will be returned by the step 1 above. This will pop up a browser window, which will access the given BIMbots server, on which you must have a valid user already logged in. You will land on a page that asks you to confirm. Upon confirmation, you will receive a token and an url. Save them to your config file with:

`>>> bimbots.save_authentication('http://localhost:8082/', 2097206, 'Simple Analyses Service', service_url, token)`

The first URL is used to bind this service to a given server in the config file. You can use either the server name, as I did above, or the /servicelist URL obtained by the first step above in these instructions. service_id, service_name are obtained in step 1 above, and service_url, token are obtained via the web interface opened in step 2.

After you properly registered the service, you can now try sending it a test file:

`send_test_payload('http://localhost:8082/', 2097206)`

There are more functions to interact with services. Check the [API documentation](doc/documentation.md) for the full list of available functions.
